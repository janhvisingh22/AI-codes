initiates all the vertices in the graph
delect the node highest degree to color it with any colors
chose the colors to be used in the graph with the help of selection color so that that no adjacent color is having the same color
check thee color can be added and if it does add it to the solution set
repeat the process from step 2 until the solution set is ready
